## Directions
Mix together brown sugar, 1 tbsp. flour, and cinnamon. Blen in melted butter and nuts. Use as filling and topping. Sift together 3/4 cup flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles corn meal. Blend together beaten egg and milk; add vanilla. Beat liquid mixture into dry ingredients just until well mixed. Pour half of the batter into 6 well-greased and floured, 2-1/2 inch muffin tins (use muffin tin liners, if desired). Sprinkle with half of the streusel filling. Add remaining batter, and sprinkle rest of filling on top. Bake in a 350Â° F. oven for 25 minutes or until done. Serve warm with butter.
