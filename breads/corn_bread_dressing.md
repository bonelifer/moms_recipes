Corn-Bread Dressing
===================

1 loaf bread (browned lightly in slow oven + crumbled)
3 c. cornbread (2 pans, not quickmix)
3 eggs
1/8 t. pepper
1 t. salt
1 stalk celery
2 medium onions

1. Moisten with some liquid (save plenty for gravy) from turkey & giblets
2. Add more butter (1 stick already used on turkey) & warm water
3. Cook covered at slow temp so bottom & sides won't burn
3. Bake at 300° for 1.5-2 hours
